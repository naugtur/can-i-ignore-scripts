Found following packages with scripts:
[ ignore ] 'monorepo-symlink-test' has scripts but they can be ignored 
             reason: false positive

             reason: funding

## Contributing

I'm in the process of figuring out how to populate `data.json`. I crawled npm starting at the 1000 most popular packages from 2019 and all their dependencies.

You're welcome to report your recommendations what to ignore or keep as pull requests to `data.json`. 

The file also contains a `todo` section with the packages I found but didn't review yet. I'll appreciate PRs with work on that too.
